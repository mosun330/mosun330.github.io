I am a PhD student in [Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech supervised by Prof.[Francesca Storici](https://storicilab.gatech.edu/).Before my PhD, I earned my bachelor degree in Pharmacy from Beijing University of Chinese medicine and my master degree in [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/bioinformatics-computational-biology) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute(WPI).

I'm a big fan of basketball and football. In my spare time, I like traveling and watching movies.



Research Interests
======
My research interests is using bioinformatic methods to study the principle and biologically meaningful patterns of genomics, especially in:

1) Explore ribonucleotides(rNMPs) and R-loops functions in DNA repair and human disease;

2) Machine learning model for de novo modification detection;

3) Single cell epigenomics.
